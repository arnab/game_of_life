<h1>Objects</h1>

<h2>GameOfLife</h2>

<p>Top level namespace (module). Has the following things:</p>

<h3>Game</h3>

<ul>
<li>incorporates rules</li>
<li>gets the input (<em>seed</em>)</li>
<li>and waits for <em>tick</em>s</li>
</ul>

<h3>Board</h3>

<ul>
<li>has a grid (2d array) of Cells</li>
<li>checks integrety after every tick, like:

<ul>
<li>is it a filled shape (orthogonal square)?<br></li>
<li>anything out of bound? or should that be inside the Cell</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Cell</h4>

<ul>
<li>x, y - coordinates (positive integers)</li>
<li>state: :live or :dead

<ul>
<li>do we need a state machine or is a simple [:live, :dead].cycle enough for now?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>guards against out of bound type of problems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by loneliness.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Player</h3>

<ul>
<li>do we need one? there isn&#39;t really a real player, but we can assume one which just calls Game#tick *</li>
</ul>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<p>Space-complexity wise an infinite grid might be tricky because each tick results in a board which is a pure function of the previous state of the board. In other words, if it&#39;s really infinite, or very large, it will be impossible to copy the board before every manipulation. Three options that I can see (following discussions assume there are (n x n) <em>Cell</em>s in the <em>Board</em>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep some sort of a has_changed signifier in each <em>Cell</em>. Instead of trying to change the state in-place, flip this boolean field. After all the <em>Cell</em>s have been touched, use this field to go through once more and flip the state if required.

<ul>
<li>This increases by the space required by O(n-squared * some-constant-amount-for-a-boolean), which is O(n-squared)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another simple optimization can be to go row-by-row. Every time we reach row n, where n &gt; 2, th (n-2)th row can be flushed (i.e. their state can be changed) since no <em>Cell</em> in (n-2) row can be n row&#39;s neighbor. This way only 2 rows need to copied in memory at a time.

<ul>
<li>This increases the space required by O(n). But if n is agan very large (and not n-squared) this will still not be efficient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A third approach could be to walk the <em>Board</em> in a radially outward manner, flushing the earliest-seen-<em>Cell</em>s as soon as we are in a neighborhood which is one row/column away from the first generation.

<ul>
<li>This would be very optimal but will be complicated to write. Is it worth it is the question.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions and Conslusions</h2>

<p>Given all these considerations and reassurance from my recruiter that we are looking for a <em>simple</em> OO Design I am not going to attempt any of these alternatives. Instead I&#39;ll copy the board in memory during the <em>tick</em>.</p>
